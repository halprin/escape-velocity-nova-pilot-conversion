# Escape Velocity Nova Pilot Conversion

Converts Escape Velocity Nova (EVN) pilot files from the Mac format to the Windows format.

## Run

The program takes only one command line argument: the file path to the Mac formatted pilot file. 

```shell
./evn-pilot-conversion ./path/to/pilot
```

The converted pilot file is named `<original pilot name>.converted.plt` and written into the same folder as the original pilot file.
